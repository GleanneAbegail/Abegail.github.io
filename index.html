        <h3>My Childhood</h3>

        <p>This is the early stage of my life that are full of good memories, so I came to this world on the year of the snake from loving parents, I have two siblings. Growing up I was taught how top read, to write, and to be able to differentiate colors and numbers.</p>
        <p>I have gone to school with my grandma at the age of 5 even though I have my parents I am muchcloser with my grandma and I can say that I'm a grandma's girl because whenever I attended school festivities and contests such as girl scouts, I have her to</p>
        <p>accompany me. Back then I was afraid to go to school or anywhere without my grandma, I would cry, she became my mentor, and my inspiration cause she have taught me a lot, the love of my grandma and grandpa have kept always in my heart.</p>
        </section>

        <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>

        <p>In this stage I have grown a lot of emotions such as fear, anxiety, depression or sadness because this is the stage were I have experienced many hardships, I was in highschool for 6 years so that is from Grade 7-12 going there is one way from my house. So I took</p>
        <p>a cab everyday just to go to school. The expenses is big but I have supportive parents. Not to brag but I am a person that is generous, kind, and helpful but this has became my biggest wickness, why because I have been bullied from my so called friends, they stabbed</p>
        <p>me behind my back saying that I'm so trusting, I don't know how to tell a lie from truth, they said that I clung to teachers that's why I've got high grades, but the worst of all is letting me hear that I have irresponsible parents. I ran away from the room crying</p>
        <p>my heart out because of the pain, like I told myself why are they like that I didn't harm them, I have given them a lot but why do they still treat me like a rubbish. I just cried and cried until the bell rang I have wiped my tears and went to the room with a swollen</p>
        <p>eyes. I have endured all the pain for 6 years they kept bullying me ad neglecting me. I was hospitalized with dengue my so called friends visited me not to sympathize but to eat my food. I have felt sicker that time they haven't even told me the lesons in class. But all</p>
        <p>of those have became my motivation to go further beyond my limits because I want to prove to them that their assumptions are wrong.</p>

        <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
        
        <p>The anxiety keeps growing and growing I was in the middle of the contest that day, held at Cabadbaran it is an interreligious contest between Christian schools I was one of the participants when my garndma have called me saying that my grandpa got paralyzed and can't</p>
         walk. He was charged to stay in the hospital for an operation during the contest I have pushed my limits because of the emotions I still continued to participate even though my mind went blank and my instructor got worried. The festivities ended and its time to go home</p>
        <p>I was wooried sick because of ehat happened I have gone to the hospital wew I saw my garndma and her sister in law watching him not minding that I have forgotten my shoes and telling my parents they have called my grandma and she told that I'm with her at the hospital</p>
        <p>He lasted for one month and it was time to be discharged cause he is stable. In our home I have taken care of him, he opened his eyes and talked but the happy moments didn't last long after a week I was in school when my mother called me saying that I need to urgently</p>
        <p>go home, my mind is in turmoil, the fear stroke me when I have gone home I saw my family cleaning the house, my mother came to me hugging me and telling that my grandpa is gone, imagine the devastaion or frutration that I have felt. This is the time were I started</p>
        <p>disobeying my parents, I drink liquor, going home late and it made me forgot the importance of family. Four years later I was in College I have realize my mistakes because God has sent me an angel to remind me that everything happened for a reason so I slowly and slowly</p>
        changed myself for the better and so I'm very grateful to him because he gave the strength and become my stepping stone to embrace the new me, freely being positive and express myself.
